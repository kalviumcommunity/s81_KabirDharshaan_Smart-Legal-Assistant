# ⚖️ LegalConnect — Lawyer–Client Assistance Platform

## 📌 Project Overview
**LegalConnect** is a MERN-stack powered platform that connects **lawyers** with **users (clients)** who need legal help.  

It enables:  
- Normal users to **post their legal problems**.  
- Lawyers to **create verified profiles** and offer help.  
- Users to **search & approach lawyers directly**.  
- Secure **messaging/chat system** for consultations.  
- Optional **AI-powered legal Q&A assistant** for basic queries.  

The platform works as a **legal marketplace + consultation hub**, providing a **two-way discovery system** where:  
- Lawyers can browse and respond to posted problems.  
- Users can explore lawyer profiles and request consultations.

## 💡 Concept-by-Concept Breakdown

### 1️⃣ System & User Workflow
- **Users**: Register → Post problems OR search lawyers → Chat/Hire → Give reviews.  
- **Lawyers**: Register (upload credentials) → Get verified → Browse problems OR receive client requests → Offer services.  
- **Admin**: Approves lawyers, monitors activities, handles abuse reports.

### 2️⃣ Prompting & AI Assistant (Optional Integration)
Though the main platform is **lawyer–client matching**, AI features can be integrated:  
- **Zero-Shot Prompting**: Users ask *“How to file an FIR?”* → AI answers.  
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Provide legal query examples for structured replies.  
- **Dynamic Prompting**: Tailor responses based on case type (family law vs corporate law).  
- **Structured Output**: Generate legal steps in JSON or formatted response.  
- **Function Calling**: AI triggers backend functions (e.g., stamp duty calculator).

### 3️⃣ Similarity Search (for RAG + Recommendations)
- **Cosine Similarity / Dot Product / L2 Distance**: Used for matching user problems with relevant lawyer expertise.  
- **Vector Database (FAISS / Pinecone)**: Stores embeddings of legal queries, enabling fast search and recommendations.

### 4️⃣ Evaluation Pipeline
Custom judge prompt to check if AI/legal responses are:  
- ✅ Factually correct  
- ✅ Relevant to Indian legal system  
- ✅ Non-hallucinatory  

A **testing framework** ensures that queries like *“What does CrPC 154 mean?”* return reliable answers.
